# 📘 <b>Lecture 4 — Exam Prediction + Model Answers</b>

---

# 🅐 Part A — Core Concept Questions（高概率）

---

## <b>Q1. Define High Utility Itemset Mining (HUI). Why is it needed?</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

High Utility Itemset Mining aims to find itemsets whose total utility in the database exceeds a minimum utility threshold.  

Unlike frequent itemset mining, which only considers occurrence frequency, HUI incorporates both local utility (quantity in a transaction) and global utility (item value).  

It is needed because high-value item combinations may appear infrequently but still be important for applications such as marketing and revenue analysis.

---

## <b>Q2. Explain why the Apriori principle does not apply to High Utility Itemset Mining.</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

The Apriori principle relies on downward closure: all subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.  

However, in HUI, utility is not monotonic. A superset may have higher utility than its subsets, and a subset may have low utility even if the superset is high-utility.  

Therefore, Apriori pruning cannot be directly applied.

---

## <b>Q3. What is Transaction-Weighted Utility (TWU) and why is it useful?</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

TWU of an itemset is the sum of the transaction weights of all transactions containing the itemset.  

Transaction weight is the total utility of all items in a transaction.  

TWU is useful because it satisfies a downward closure property: the TWU of a subset is always greater than or equal to the TWU of its supersets.  

This allows pruning of itemsets that cannot possibly reach the minimum utility threshold.

---

## <b>Q4. Define collaborative filtering and list its main categories.</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

Collaborative filtering is a recommendation approach that predicts user preferences by leveraging similarities among users or items.  

Its main categories are:

- Neighborhood-oriented CF  
- Model-oriented CF  
- Composite CF  
    
---

## <b>Q5. What is matrix factorization in the context of recommender systems?</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

Matrix factorization decomposes the user–item matrix into two low-rank matrices:  

$$

X \approx C P^T

$$  

where \(C\) contains item factors and \(P\) contains user factors.  

It discovers latent patterns and enables dimensionality reduction, improving recommendation accuracy.

---

# 🅑 Part B — Understanding & Interpretation Questions（中高概率）

---

## <b>Q6. Explain the idea of neighborhood-oriented collaborative filtering.</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

Neighborhood-oriented CF predicts a user’s preference for an item by aggregating the preferences of similar users (user-based) or similar items (item-based).  

Similarity is often computed using cosine similarity on co-rated items.  

The final prediction is a weighted average of neighbor ratings.

---

## <b>Q7. Describe the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method for matrix factorization.</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

ALS alternates between optimizing one factor matrix while keeping the other fixed.  

Steps:  

1. Initialize \(C\) and \(P\).  
2. Fix \(P\), solve for \(C\) using least squares.  
3. Fix \(C\), solve for \(P\).  
4. Repeat until convergence.  

This avoids solving a non-convex joint optimization directly.

---

## <b>Q8. What is the purpose of RRSS in SVD?</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

RRSS (Relative Residual Sum of Squares) measures how much information is lost when approximating a matrix using only the top \(k\) singular values.  

A lower RRSS indicates a better low-rank approximation.  

It helps determine an appropriate rank \(k\).

---

# 🅒 Part C — Calculation Questions（高概率）

---

## <b>Q9. Compute the utility of an itemset.</b>

Given:  

- Global utilities: A=2, B=5  
- Transaction T contains: (A, 3), (B, 1)
    
### <b>Model Answer</b>

$$

u(A,T) = 3 \cdot 2 = 6

$$

$$

u(B,T) = 1 \cdot 5 = 5

$$

$$

u(\{A,B\},T) = 6 + 5 = 11

$$

---

## <b>Q10. Compute TWU of an itemset.</b>

Given:  

- Transaction weights:  
    - T1 = 10  
    - T3 = 7  

- Itemset {A,B} appears in T1 and T3
    
### <b>Model Answer</b>

$$

TWU(\{A,B\}) = 10 + 7 = 17

$$

---

## <b>Q11. Neighborhood CF prediction</b>

Given:  

- Neighbors of user u: users b1, b2  
- Similarities: sim(u,b1)=0.8, sim(u,b2)=0.6  
- Ratings for item j: f_{jb1}=4, f_{jb2}=2  
    
Compute predicted rating.

### <b>Model Answer</b>

$$

\hat{f}_{ju} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 4 + 0.6 \cdot 2}{0.8 + 0.6}

= \frac{3.2 + 1.2}{1.4}

= \frac{4.4}{1.4}

= 3.14

$$

---

## <b>Q12. Matrix factorization reconstruction</b>

Given:  

- Item factor \(C_j = [0.9, 0.3]\)  
- User factor \(P_u = [0.7, 0.5]\)
    
Compute predicted rating.

### <b>Model Answer</b>

$$

\hat{f}_{ju} = C_j \cdot P_u = 0.9 \cdot 0.7 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.63 + 0.15 = 0.78

$$

---

# 🅓 Part D — SVD Questions（中高概率）

---

## <b>Q13. What is truncated SVD and why is it used?</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

Truncated SVD keeps only the top \(k\) singular values and corresponding singular vectors.  

It provides a low-rank approximation of the matrix, capturing the most important latent structure while reducing noise and dimensionality.  

It is useful for recommender systems and latent pattern mining.

---

## <b>Q14. Explain how SVD relates to matrix factorization.</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

SVD decomposes a matrix as \(X = U S V^T\).  

By taking the top \(k\) singular values and defining  

$$

C = U S^{1/2},\quad P = V S^{1/2},

$$  

we obtain a factorization \(X \approx C P^T\).  

Thus, SVD provides a principled way to obtain latent factors.

---

# 🅔 Part E — Higher-Level Reasoning（老师喜欢的理解题）

---

## <b>Q15. Why is latent pattern mining important for recommender systems?</b>

### <b>Model Answer</b>

User–item data is typically sparse, noisy, and high-dimensional.  

Latent pattern mining uncovers hidden structures—such as user preferences or item categories—that are not directly observable.  

These latent factors improve prediction accuracy, reduce dimensionality, and enable generalization to unseen data.
