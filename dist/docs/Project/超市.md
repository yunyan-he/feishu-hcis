✉️ Motivation Letter (Concise Version)

<b>Dear Ms. Simonetti,</b>

I am applying for the Student Assistant (WHF) position at the Institute for Food and Resource Economics, University of Bonn. My strongest motivation is to gain practical development experience and contribute to the Lab Supermarket project.

During my bachelor’s studies in Computer Science and Technology, I built two Android full-stack projects and studied relational databases, which gave me systematic thinking and a solid foundation in backend logic. I have also used Python for data visualization and developed a Pascal-to-C compiler, further strengthening my programming skills.

To prepare for this position, I have already created a small demo in Python that integrates a product database, a point-of-sale (POS) system, and basic inventory management. This demonstrates my ability to translate requirements into working code and my eagerness to learn by doing.

I am highly motivated to accumulate real-world development experience, refine my skills, and contribute to your team. I believe this position will be an excellent opportunity to grow as a developer while supporting innovative research.

<b>Sincerely,</b>  
 Yunyan He

这个版本简洁直接，重点突出：

<b>系统思维</b>（Android全栈 + 编译器）

<b>Python能力</b>（数据可视化 + demo）

<b>关系数据库经验</b>（本科课程背景）

<b>动机强烈</b>（希望积累经验）

要不要我再帮你写一个 <b>更短的半页版</b>，适合在岗位只要求 very short motivation letter 的情况下使用？
